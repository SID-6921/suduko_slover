# suduko_solver
This Python code solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as regions or boxes) contain all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The `print_grid` function takes a 9x9 grid as input and prints it in a human-readable format.

2. The `is_safe` function checks if it is safe to place a particular number (`num`) in a given position (`row`, `col`) on the Sudoku grid. It checks three conditions to ensure it's safe:
   a. The same `num` should not be present in the same row.
   b. The same `num` should not be present in the same column.
   c. The same `num` should not be present in the 3x3 subgrid containing the (`row`, `col`) cell.

3. The `solve_sudoku` function is the main function that solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking approach. It starts by finding an empty cell using the `find_empty_cell` function. If there are no empty cells (all cells are filled), it means the Sudoku puzzle is solved, and the function returns `True`. If there is an empty cell, it tries to place numbers from 1 to 9 in that cell and recursively calls itself to solve the updated grid. If a valid solution is found, it returns `True`, and the puzzle is solved. Otherwise, it backtracks and continues with the next possible number until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

4. The `find_empty_cell` function looks for an empty cell (cell containing 0) in the Sudoku grid and returns its row and column indices. If there are no empty cells, it returns `None`.

5. Finally, the driver code initializes a Sudoku grid as a 9x9 list (`grid`). The `solve_sudoku` function is called with the initial grid. If a solution exists, it prints the solved grid using the `print_grid` function. Otherwise, it prints "No solution exists."

To summarize, this code uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a given Sudoku puzzle and prints the solution if one exists. If there is no solution possible, it notifies the user.
